## 📊 Data Flow Architecture

```
Trade Execution → Trade Memory → Feature Engineering → ML Training → Recommendations → Human Review → Playbook Updates → Live Trading
```

### Input Data Sources:
1. **TradeMemory**: P&L, regime, confidence, strategy, timing, risk metrics
2. **Playbook**: Current parameter values per regime
3. **MarketRegime**: Regime classification and transitions
4. **MLPredictor**: Forecast accuracy tracking

### Feature Categories:
- **Temporal**: Hour, day of week, trade duration
- **Market**: Volatility regime, regime transitions
- **Performance**: Strategy/symbol historical performance
- **Risk**: Actual vs target risk ratios, confidence distributions
- **Context**: Leverage usage, position sizing patterns

## 🎯 Optimization Algorithms

### Leverage Optimization
```python
# Conservative approach based on win rate and volatility
if win_rate > 0.6 and volatility < threshold:
    recommended_leverage = current * 1.2  # Increase
elif win_rate < 0.4 or high_volatility:
    recommended_leverage = current * 0.8  # Decrease
```

### Risk Ratio Optimization
```python
# Align targets with actual performance
actual_ratio = avg_win / avg_loss
if actual_ratio > target * 1.3:
    increase_target()  # Can be more aggressive
elif actual_ratio < target * 0.7:
    decrease_target()  # Be more conservative
```

### Confidence Threshold Optimization
```python
# Find optimal threshold balancing profitability and frequency
for threshold in [50, 60, 70, 80]:
    score = avg_pnl * win_rate * log(trade_count)
    if score > best_score:
        optimal_threshold = threshold
```

## 🔧 Configuration & Safety

### Safety Mechanisms:
- **Maximum Change Limits**: 30% per tuning session
- **Minimum Data Requirements**: 50+ trades for meaningful analysis
- **Human Review Mode**: All changes require approval by default
- **Risk Classification**: Conservative, medium, aggressive change categories
- **Rollback Capability**: Tuning history with reversion options

### Configurable Parameters:
```python
config = {
    'min_trades_for_tuning': 50,
    'lookback_days': 30,
    'confidence_threshold': 0.7,
    'max_parameter_change': 0.3,
    'retraining_frequency': 7,
    'human_review_required': True
}
```
